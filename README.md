# MotionLayoutLandingPageExample
Example of how to use MotionLayout for a lading page (based on the mobile landing page from [LEC](https://lec.it/en/)). The purpose of this repository is to show how to use layout tools to create a stunning landing page and make a first good impression. No Kotlin code was used to make this animation possible.

## Original vs My version

This app should be similar to the landing page on [LEC](https://lec.it/en/). I used the texts and images available on the website and font provided by Google.
